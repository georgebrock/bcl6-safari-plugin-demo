# Example Safari plugin

This is an example Safari plugin that accompanies the "Hacking OS X: How to build a Safari plugin" talk I gave at Barcamp London 6. See the [presentation notes](http://georgebrock.com/bcl6) for more information.

## Usage:

1. Build the Xcode project
2. Create the following directory: _/Library/InputManagers/BCL6Demo/_
3. Copy _[this project]/Info_ and _[this project]/build/Release/BCL6Demo.bundle_ to that directory
